# To-Do:
* More examples on Directives
    Explore the compile, pre-link, post-link and controller functionality.
* Maybe look into some on-scroll events. Look into de-bouncing and other features from [lodash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tnqPv9Stmg).
* $resource and how to use it.
* caching route templates.

# Observations On Angular
This is a collection of simple and quite isolated code to give example and articulate certain features of Angular.

I plan to keep adding to this repository over time, highlighting any common and not-so-common gotchas and quirks that Angular has.

## Sharing Data Using Services
This module examines the various methods of sharing data from services, the good ways and bad. Scenarios include:
* ng-binding to a service function result.
* Binding scope values to service objects and numerics.

## Directives
* Very simple example on how to examine service values from a directive.
